Hello thereðŸ‘‹! This time I have completed several projects from one of the freeCodeCamp (FCC) curricula, namely Responsive Web Design. 

Responsive Web Design Projects
Time to put your newly learnt skills to work. By working on these projects, you will get a chance to apply all of the skills, principles, and concepts you have learned so far: HTML, CSS, Visual Design, Accessibility, and more.

In this projects, technology stack that I use to complete this curricula is HTML, plain CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and SCSS. I don't use jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue because it's not recommended for these projects.
